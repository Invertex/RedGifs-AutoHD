# Gfycat-AutoHD
Automatically changes Gfycat/RedGifs videos to HD mode, improves progress bar interaction and strips "upgrade to pro" adverts.</br>

Will also persist the mute/unmute value for audios on the website so that you no longer have to click Umute everytime you want to hear the audio.</br>
Simply click mute or unmute to permanently persist that value for all future videos watched, turning it into a permanent toggle instead of a default "mute". (This is how Gfycat should have done it...)

Should work on Gfycat/RedGifs embeds on other websites as well, including Reddit.
