# Gfycat-AutoHD
Automatically changes Gfycat/RedGifs videos to HD mode, improves progress bar interaction and strips "upgrade to pro" adverts.</br>

Also provides persistence for the autoplay and audio mute/unmute settings so that you no longer have to manually change them, even in private/incognito mode.<br>
Simply toggle a setting to permanently persist it for all future videos watched, overriding the defaults.
(This is how Gfycat should have done it...)


Should work on Gfycat/RedGifs embeds on other websites as well, including Reddit.
